# knowledge-panel-scraper
knowledge-panel-scraper is a Python 3 command line tool that scrapes Google's [Knowledge Panels](https://support.google.com/business/answer/6331288?hl=en) to retrieve the phone numbers, addresses, and hours of an inputted list of businesses.

## Installation

Use git to clone the repository, then install required libraries with the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jnovak98/knowledge-panel-scraper.git
cd knowledge-panel-scraper
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
python3 knowledge-panel-scraper.py inputfile.csv

inputfile.csv should be a plain text CSV file with each row containing data to generate a search query for a specific business.
For example:
```csv

"Kelly's Garage,Perry,NY",2868 STATE ROUTE 246,PERRY,NY,14530,(585) 237-2504
